 This repository contains tools ðŸ§° and frameworks ðŸ“ƒ to solve technical problems using LLMs ðŸ¤–. It is based on TRIZ, Inventive Engineering and other problem- solving methodologies. 

## Contradiction Matrix
Contradiction Matrix is one of the most wide-spread tools in TRIZ. It is a matrix with 39 rows and columns, each correcponding to unique evaluation parameters that form a technical contradiction. Inside the matrix there are numbers from 1 to 40, corresponding to the 40 Inventive Principles (IP) that represent classes of solutions in TRIZ.
